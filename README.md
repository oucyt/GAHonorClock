# GAHonorClock
The project is mainly to achieve the following clock animation:
<div align=center>

</div>


We present three implementations in this project. In the next section, we will briefly introduce these three implementations.

### 1、Image mask
The following image shows how the above animation can be implemented by masking.
<div align=center>
  <img src="https://github.com/Ajian-studio/GAHonorClock/blob/master/raw/how_to_use_mask_img.png" width="50%">
</div>
The result is as follow：
<div align=center>
  <img src="https://github.com/Ajian-studio/GAHonorClock/blob/master/raw/honor_clock_by_image.gif" width="35%">
</div>

### 2、Path mask
In this implementations, we use path to simulate a mask, and result is as follow:
<div align=center>

</div>
### 3、Calculation
In this implementations, we draw the special clock scale lines by calculation, and result is as follow:
<div align=center>

</div>
